## Hello, I’m Romina Mahinpei (she/her).
Thank you for taking the time to check my GitHub. Before diving into my projects, here are a few facts about me:
- I’m currently learning C & C++.
- I'm always looking to collaborate with others on new projects.
- Fun fact: I am celiac!


Feel free to contact with me - I am always open to new conversations! You can [email](mailto:[romina.mahinpei@yahoo.com]) me or find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/romina-mahinpei/).
